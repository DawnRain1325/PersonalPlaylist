이 노래는 it's about you, baby
Only you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
내가 힘들 때, 울 것 같을 때
기운도 이젠 나지 않을 때
(It's you) 날 걱정하네, (it's you) 날 웃게하네
말 안 해도 돼, boy, what do you say?
멀리든 언제든지 달려와
(They keep on asking me, "who is he?")
바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나
(They keep on asking me, "who is he?")
"이게 말이 되니?" 난 물어봐
(They keep on asking me, "who is he?")
너는 말야, he's the one that's living in my system, baby
Oh my, oh my God! 예상했어 나
I was really hoping that he will come through
Oh my, oh my God! 단 너뿐이야
Asking all the time about what I should do
No, I can never let him go, 너만 생각나 24
난 행운아야 정말로, I know, I know
널 알기 전까지는 나, 의미 없었어 전부 다
내 맘이 끝이 없는 걸, I know, I know
I'm going crazy, right?
어디서든, 몇 번이든
There ain't nothing else that I would hold on to
I hear his voice through all the noise
잠시라도 내 손 놓지 마, no, no
걱정 없잖아 'cause I got someone
혼자라도 괜찮아 'cause I love someone
멀리든 언제든지 달려와

Baby, baby
Bab-baby (I'm going crazy, right?)
Baby, baby (I'm going crazy, right?)
Bab-baby (너와 나)
My heart is glowing, it's glowing up (glowing up)
너랑만 있으면 무서울 게 없어 (glowing up)
가득 메워진, 다 메워진 (붉어진)
My heart is glowing, it'd be glowing ('cause he!)
Oh my, oh my God! 예상했어 나
I was really hoping that he will come through
Oh my, oh my God! 단 너뿐이야
Asking all the time about what I should do (너와 나)
No, I can never let him go, he's right there for me, 24
난 행운아야 정말로, I know, I know (너와 나)
널 알기 전까지는 나, 의미 없었어 전부 다, 어떡해
My heart is glowing, it's glowing
My heart is glowing up, so I can't sleep at night
