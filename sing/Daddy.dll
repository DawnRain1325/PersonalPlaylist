I got it from my daddy
Daddy
I feel nice, you look nice
널 보자마자 나 어머나 땡잡았스
Don't think twice, 이미 게임 끝났스
You'll be my curry, I'll be your rice
My name is P-S-Y, 한국말로 박재상
너의 아련한 눈동자에 빠져서 헤엄치고파
오빠 달린다 꽉 붙잡아 언니야
나는 아름다운 아가씨의 동반자
Hold up, wait a minute
지금부터 선수끼리
밤이 아까워, turn up louder
불타오르는 아름다운 그대여
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
I'm on fire, take you higher
넌 한 폭의 명작, 난 아낌없는 buyer
Don't be a liar, 까고 말해봐요
I'll be your honey, never expire
낮에는 잠만 자, 밤이 오면 상남자
널 보자마자 나, 너무 좋아서 뻑이 가
척 보면 압니다, 신나면 어린애 입니다
오빠가 오방가 깜빡이 안 키고 훅 들어갑니다
Hold up, wait a minute
지금부터 선수끼리
밤이 아까워, turn up louder
불타오르는 아름다운 그대여
How you like me now?

Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad

Listen, my papa was a superman (hey)
그대로 받아왔어 그 몸매 (hey)
신사이길 거부하는 신사
이 구역에 미친 놈은 바로 나 (hey)
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
